# Background / Lore Hook:
The Null was the result of a quantum phase experiment intended to “subtract” mass from matter to create anti-gravitational tech.

Instead, it phased a human subject halfway out of reality. Now, what remains is a hateful echo — a creature desperate to be “seen” again.

# Idle / Wandering Behavior
Rememberence: Follows ghost paths from the day it was created. There is an office room of the employee who was partially phased out of reality (seeded when this monster is randomly selected for the level). The Null will patrol from there to the quantum phase experiment room (also seeded), and rewind back until some other state is triggerred.

Wall-Phasing: Sometimes it sinks partially into walls along its rememberence path, seemingly frozen — but if a player gets too close, it "unfreezes" and pursues.
This coincides with its movement-- it appears glitchy with frequent frame skips, as if it's phasing in and out of reality.

Amush: Waits near doors or corners. When a player runs by, it grabs and drags them into darkness until phasing away. Rare, but terrifying.

# Environmental Cues
Timeline bleeds/memory echoes: In certain rooms near its patrol path (esp. the office or lab), players might:

- See ghost projections of the Null's human self, walking through walls or standing at terminals.

- Hear out-of-order intercoms announcing mundane schedule items from the day of the accident ("Dr. Lemke, please report to Testing Room 3.").

# Mechanics
With proximity to the Null, players gain stacks of quantum "scars." These are debuffs that alter the gameplay experience of the player.

Timeloop scar (stage 1): Occasional hard stutter/replay of last 3 seconds; movement rewinds. You see ghostly projections of your past self walking ahead
