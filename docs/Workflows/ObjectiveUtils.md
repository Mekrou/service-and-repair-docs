# Objective Utilities (GUI)

## About

Objective Utilities on the `Client` are modules with functions that help with the logic of the `ObjectiveHandler` inside the `Interface` Module.

These can be anything, but I have used them to act as similar to [``UIHandlers``](UIHandlers.md) in a sense that they handle the specific types of objectives and their GUI Instances.
